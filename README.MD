# ToDo app

This is a small ToDo app built with JavaScript Vanilla. I did this because I like to prove myself that even though JS frameworks are awesome, you can still build amazing things without them.

## Demo

You can have a look on [https://nardoyala-todo.netlify.app/](https://nardoyala-todo.netlify.app/)

## Some Features

- You can add, delete, edit and cross out any item in your list.
- Stores all your ToDos in your localstorage, so they will wait for you even if you refresh the page.
